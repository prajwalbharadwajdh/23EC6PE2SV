Recompiling... reason: file './digital_clock.sv' is newer than expected.

		Caching library 'worklib' ....... Done
	Elaborating the design hierarchy:
ncelab: *W,DSEMEL: This SystemVerilog design will be simulated as per IEEE 1800-2009 SystemVerilog simulation semantics. Use -disable_sem2009 option for turning off SV 2009 simulation semantics.

	Extracting FSMs for coverage:
		worklib.digital_clock
		worklib.clock_test
		worklib.clock_tb
	Total FSMs extracted = 0
	Building instance overlay tables: .................... Done
	Enabling instrumentation for coverage types: block expression FSM toggle functional
ncelab: *W,COVDCL: By default expression coverage is scored only for Verilog logical operators (|| and &&) and VHDL logical operators (OR, AND, NOR, and NAND), and is scored only in condition expressions. To score coverage for other operators and for expressions in other statements, use the "set_expr_coverable_operators" and "set_expr_coverable_statements" coverage configuration file commands with suitable options at elaboration.
	Generating native compiled code:
		worklib.clock_tb:sv <0x040aee6b>
			streams:   6, words:  2595
		worklib.clock_test:sv <0x3b82cc69>
			streams:  15, words: 15217
		worklib.digital_clock:sv <0x7a96007f>
			streams:   3, words:  1620
	Building instance specific data structures.
ncelab: *W,CGPIDF: Covergroup "per_instance" option , by default, is set as 0.
ncelab: *N,COVCGN: Coverage configuration file command "set_covergroup -new_instance_reporting" can be specified to improve the scoping and naming of covergroup instances. It may be noted that subsequent merging of a coverage database saved with this command and a coverage database saved without this command is not allowed.
	Loading native compiled code:     .................... Done
